## Objective
Refocus `Staff_Kit` as a native desktop-only application and fully separate it from the `AssetDesk-Pro` web migration track.

## Work Completed
- Reviewed the full `Staff_Kit` workspace and related Markdown documentation.
- Confirmed the active app remains a native desktop app built with Tauri, Rust, React, Vite, and SQLite.
- Verified there is no direct runtime dependency from `Staff_Kit` to `E:\AssetDesk-Pro`.
- Removed mixed web-project artifacts from the `Staff_Kit` repo:
  - `web/`
  - `openspec/`
  - `ConvertWEB.md`
  - `docs/business-notes.md`
- Rewrote internal project guidance to match desktop-native direction:
  - `.agent/project-context.md`
  - `.agent/workflows/implement-feature.md`
  - `.agent/workflows/brainstorm.md`
- Added cleanup documentation:
  - `docs/desktop-separation-report.md`
- Pruned internal agent/skill content that was web-focused, Stitch-focused, or unrelated to desktop-native development.
- Updated ESLint config to ignore `.worktrees/**` so quality checks stop scanning unrelated worktree artifacts.

## Validation
- Ran `npm run check:quality`
- Result: passed
  - ESLint: passed
  - TypeScript build/typecheck: passed
  - Vite production build: passed
  - Tauri `cargo check`: passed

## Git History Added
- `5c6fbe1` - `chore(repo): remove web migration artifacts from desktop workspace`
- `a6490ec` - `chore(agent): prune non-desktop skills and ignore worktrees`

## Current State
`Staff_Kit` is now cleaner and aligned as an independent desktop-native project, with web migration/spec baggage removed from the main workspace.

## Next Suggested Focus
- Continue feature work only against the desktop stack (`src/` + `src-tauri/`)
- Keep docs and internal workflows desktop-only
- Avoid reintroducing `AssetDesk-Pro` web planning into this repo
